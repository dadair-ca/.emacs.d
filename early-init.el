;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;

;;; Code:

(setq gc-cons-threshold 402653184)

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

(unless (and (display-graphic-p) (eq system-type 'darwin))
  (setq menu-bar-mode nil))

(setq tool-bar-mode nil)
(setq scroll-bar-mode nil)
(modify-all-frames-parameters '((vertical-scroll-bars)))

;;; early-init.el ends here
